# OSIAM - Open Source Identity and Access Management

OSIAM is a secure identity management solution providing REST based services for
authentication and authorization. We achieve this by implementing two important
open standards:

* [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/)
* [SCIM v2](http://www.simplecloud.info/)

OSIAM is published under the MIT licence, giving you the greatest freedom
possible to utilize OSIAM in you project or product.

## Use cases

* [Single app with OSIAM](docs/single-app-use-case.md) as free backing store for
  users and groups and local auth service.
* [Distributed app with OSIAM](docs/distributed-app-use-case.md) as central
  identity store and auth service.
* [Publish your app's API with OSIAM](docs/protected-api-use-case.md) as auth
  service for 3rd-parties and allow safe access to your user's data.

## Get started
